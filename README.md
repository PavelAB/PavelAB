## ðŸš² Iâ€™m Pavel

Iâ€™m a web developer with a strong passion for creating and building diverse projects. I work on personal projects and am currently seeking a new professional opportunity.

I enjoy working with React and Node.js on my projects, and I am also learning C# as I aim to take on a new challenge by rewriting my backend in a cleaner, more structured language.

I appreciate the opportunity to work on both backend and frontend tasks. I find it fascinating to create a project from scratch: conducting analysis, defining goals, and bringing it to life. But Iâ€™d never say no to a bit of help from a designer! ðŸ˜‰
